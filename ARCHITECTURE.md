# Tony Co-Assistant Architecture ðŸ§ 

## System Overview

Tony is designed as an integrated, living system where all components work together harmoniously. Think of it as a digital organism that grows, learns, and adapts through its interactions.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Central Nervous System
- **State Management**
  - Centralized state store
  - Real-time state synchronization
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Pub/sub system for component communication

- **Memory System**
  - Unified memory store
  - Real-time memory updates
  - Memory persistence
  - Memory indexing and retrieval

### 2. Neural Network (Data Flow)
- **Bidirectional Communication**
  - Event bus for system-wide communication
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - State propagation
  - Feedback loops

- **Knowledge Graph**
  - Connected data structure
  - Relationship mapping
  - Knowledge inference
  - Learning pathways

### 3. Component Integration

#### UX Repository
- Connected to all other components
- Feeds into AI suggestions
- Informs design patterns
- Updates School Bench

#### School Bench
- Learns from all interactions
- Updates design patterns
- Informs AI suggestions
- Feeds back into UX Repository

#### AI Design Suggestions
- Pulls from UX Repository
- Applies School Bench learning
- Uses Design Asset Library
- Updates knowledge base

#### Design Asset Library
- Integrated with AI suggestions
- Connected to design patterns
- Feeds into School Bench
- Updates UX Repository

### 4. Learning and Growth

#### Continuous Learning
- All interactions feed into learning system
- Cross-component knowledge sharing
- Pattern recognition
- Adaptive behavior

#### Memory Management
- Short-term memory (active sessions)
- Long-term memory (persistent storage)
- Memory indexing
- Knowledge retrieval

#### Feedback Loops
- User feedback processing
- System performance monitoring
- Learning optimization
- Pattern recognition

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface TonyState {
  memory: MemoryStore;
  learning: LearningSystem;
  design: DesignSystem;
  ux: UXRepository;
  school: SchoolBench;
  assets: AssetLibrary;
}
```

### Event System
```typescript
interface TonyEvent {
  type: string;
  source: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: number;
  context: any;
}
```

### Memory Structure
```typescript
interface MemoryNode {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  data: any;
  connections: string[];
  metadata: {
    source: string;
    confidence: number;
    lastUpdated: number;
  };
}
```
