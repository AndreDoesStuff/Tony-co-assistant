# Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your Tony Assistant is ready for production deployment.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env.production` file created from `env.production.example`
- [ ] `REACT_APP_MONGODB_URI` configured with real MongoDB connection string
- [ ] `REACT_APP_MONGODB_DB` set to desired database name
- [ ] `REACT_APP_ENABLE_MONGODB` set to `true`
- [ ] `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT` set to `production`
- [ ] All sensitive credentials are secure and not committed to version control

### MongoDB Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account created (or self-hosted MongoDB configured)
- [ ] Database user created with read/write permissions
- [ ] Network access configured (IP whitelist or 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
- [ ] Connection string tested and working
- [ ] Database indexes created automatically (handled by application)

### Application Testing
- [ ] All tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] Production build successful: `npm run build`
- [ ] Local production test: `npm run test:production`
- [ ] MongoDB connection tested in production build
- [ ] All core features working (Memory System, UX Repository, etc.)
- [ ] Cross-component communication verified
- [ ] Error handling tested

### Security Review
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (for production deployment)
- [ ] Content Security Policy configured
- [ ] CORS settings appropriate for production
- [ ] Rate limiting considered (if needed)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Quick Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Setup production environment
npm run setup:production

# 2. Edit .env.production with your MongoDB credentials

# 3. Run automated deployment
npm run deploy
```

### Manual Deployment Steps
1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   cp env.production.example .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with your credentials
   ```

2. **Build Application**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy to Platform**
   - **Vercel**: `npm run deploy:vercel`
   - **Netlify**: `npm run deploy:netlify`
   - **Manual**: Upload `build/` folder to web server

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add all variables from `.env.production` to your deployment platform
   - Ensure `REACT_APP_` prefix is maintained

## ‚úÖ Post-Deployment Verification

### Connection Testing
- [ ] MongoDB connection established successfully
- [ ] No connection errors in browser console
- [ ] Data persistence working (create, read, update, delete)
- [ ] Sync operations functioning properly

### Feature Testing
- [ ] Memory System operations
- [ ] UX Repository functionality
- [ ] Learning System features
- [ ] Component communication
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance under load

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS working correctly
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Environment variables properly loaded
- [ ] MongoDB credentials secure

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Application loads within acceptable time
- [ ] MongoDB operations perform well
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# Check connection string format
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Verify network access
# Check if IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas

# Test connection manually
# Use MongoDB Compass or mongo shell to test
```

### Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# Ensure variables start with REACT_APP_
REACT_APP_MONGODB_URI=...
REACT_APP_MONGODB_DB=...

# Restart application after changes
# Clear browser cache if needed
```

### Build Issues
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run build

# Verify all dependencies installed
npm install

# Check Node.js version (16+ required)
node --version
```

### Deployment Platform Issues
- **Vercel**: Check environment variables in dashboard
- **Netlify**: Verify build settings and environment variables
- **Manual**: Check web server configuration and file permissions

## üìä Monitoring Setup

### Recommended Monitoring Tools
- [ ] **MongoDB Atlas Monitoring** (built-in)
- [ ] **Application Performance Monitoring** (Sentry, LogRocket)
- [ ] **Uptime Monitoring** (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] **Error Tracking** (Sentry, Bugsnag)
- [ ] **Analytics** (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- [ ] MongoDB connection status
- [ ] Application response times
- [ ] Error rates and types
- [ ] Database performance
- [ ] User activity and engagement
- [ ] Memory usage and leaks

## üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB Atlas usage and costs
- [ ] Review and rotate credentials periodically
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Backup important data (MongoDB Atlas provides automatic backups)
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Review error logs and fix issues

### Scaling Considerations
- [ ] Monitor database size and performance
- [ ] Consider MongoDB Atlas scaling options
- [ ] Implement caching if needed
- [ ] Optimize queries and indexes
- [ ] Plan for user growth
