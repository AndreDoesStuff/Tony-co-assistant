### Data Flow
1. User sends a message via chat interface
2. System builds context from UX repository, assets, and learning data
3. AI service generates suggestions based on context and query
4. Suggestions are displayed with reasoning and implementation guides
5. User can provide feedback or mark suggestions as implemented
6. Feedback is used to improve future suggestions
